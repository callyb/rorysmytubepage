                    Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Rorysmytube run by Pixelist Design. We will protect your/your child's personal information and right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or anything to do with your personal information, please contact us at <a href='mailto: carole@pixelist.design'>carole@pixelist.design</a></p></br>

                    <h2>ESSENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        Please note that the Website is a private site for Rory and his friends. The only people who are given the url are friends and family and the only reason we take names/email addresses are to update friends and family when new videos are uploaded. Names & emails are NEVER shared with any outside party and are deleted from our database on request from the registered email address. We require confirmation of details by parents and will not accept any subscription from a child we believe to be under 13 without getting the parent's email address.  We do this to keep children safe on our site and because we have to by law. We use videos stored on Youtube, and a secure database & authentication supplied by Google Firebase
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We collect a child's full name and email address, and a password so that they can change or delete their contact info if they want to.  We also collect parent's name & email address for anyone under 13.
                    </p></br>
                    <h2>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We use a child's email address to send them updates when new videos are posted and occasional updates on 567turtle and his videos.  We use parent's contact details to get permission from them for their child to receive updates.  We use the password for the child or parent to change or delete their contact information any time they want to.
                    </p></br>
                    <h2>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We don't expect to share your information with anyone, and we will not be sharing our mailing list for any reason.  We would only share information with your consent, to comply with the law, to provide you with services, or to protect your rights.  
                    </p></br>
                    <h2>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We keep your information for as long as necessary to provide you with updates as shown in point 2, unless otherwise required by law. Once we are not doing this any more either because we have discontinued rorysmytube or because updates we send you no longer go through to the email address we have for you, then we will delete our record of you.
                    </p></br>
                    <h2>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We aim to protect your personal information by organising our information and keeping it protected in a secure database provided by Google (Firebase). Even though we try very hard to make sure your information is protected, there is no storage that is 100% safe on the internet, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals or other people will not be able to get around our security and collect, steal or change your information.  Although we do not expect this to happen on rorysmytube, we have to tell you that you give us your information at your own risk.  You should also only use our website or any website on a secure computer or device, and take any precautions you can to keep your connection secure.
                    </p></br></h2>
                    <h2>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.  If you would like to do this you can do so by clicking on the 'user' icon in the search bar on rorysmytube.
                    </p></br>
                    <h2>7. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes.  We will update this to make sure we comply with the law and provide a good service for our users.
                    </p></br>
                    <h2>8. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</h2>
                    <p>
